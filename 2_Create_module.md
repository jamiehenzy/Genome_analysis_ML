Each student has been assigned a module (see bottom of page). Create a handout of basic information on your topic that is appropriate for introducing undergraduate students to the material. Imagine the type of information, figures, or resources that you would find most helpful yourself. Length should be a minimum of one page of information, maximum three. 

Submit the material as a pdf in the form of either a handout or slides. 

Have fun with it! On your resumé you'll be able to say you helped put together an instructional module on AlphaFold and ML. The modules will aid in introducing students of the new Computational Project Lab to AlphaFold, so thanks!

1.	Introduction to Protein Structure and Folding
+ Review of protein structure levels (primary–quaternary)
+ Why protein folding is critical to function
+ Historical efforts to understand and predict folding
2.	The Protein Structure Prediction Problem & the Emergence of AlphaFold
+ Why predicting protein structure is difficult
+ Traditional approaches and their limitations
+ The breakthrough of AlphaFold and who created it (DeepMind)
3.	Accessing and Using AlphaFold
+ How to access AlphaFold predictions (e.g., AlphaFold DB, ColabFold)
+ Demonstrate using the database for a protein of interest
+ Explain the output (confidence scores, structural visualization)
4.	How AlphaFold Works – Part 1: Input Data and Feature Extraction
+ Multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), templates, and evolutionary info
+ What kind of data AlphaFold requires and how it’s prepared
+ Simplified explanation of how the input is processed
5.	How AlphaFold Works – Part 2: Neural Network Architecture and Prediction
+ Basic overview of the deep learning model
+ Concepts like attention, spatial relationships, and structure generation
+ Emphasize intuitive understanding over technical depth
6.	Applications of AlphaFold in Biology and Medicine
+ Case studies in disease research, drug development, and functional prediction
+ Real-world examples of how AlphaFold is being used in research
7.	Limitations and Challenges of AlphaFold
+ Issues with low-confidence regions, protein complexes, and dynamic structures
+ What AlphaFold can’t currently do
+ Cautions about overinterpretation
8.	The Future of AlphaFold and Protein Structure Prediction
+ What’s next? (AlphaFold 3, AlphaFold-Multimer, etc.)
+ Emerging tools and directions in AI-driven biology
+ Long-term implications for biology, medicine, and education
